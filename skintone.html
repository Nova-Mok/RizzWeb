        <p>Understanding your skin tone is a fundamental step in enhancing your personal style and making confident fashion choices. Your skin tone influences which colors complement you the most, ensuring that your outfits not only look good but also highlight your natural beauty.</p>
        
        <h2>1. What is Skin Tone?</h2>
        <p>Skin tone refers to the natural color of your skin. It’s different from skin color, which can vary due to sun exposure or other factors. Determining your skin tone helps in selecting clothing colors, makeup, and accessories that enhance your appearance.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Categories of Skin Tones</h2>
        <p>Generally, skin tones are categorized into three main groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm:</strong> Yellow, golden, or peach undertones.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Pink, red, or blue undertones.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> A balance of both warm and cool undertones.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. How to Determine Your Skin Tone</h2>
        <p>Here are some methods to help you identify your skin tone:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vein Test:</strong Look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear green, you likely have a warm skin tone. If they look blue or purple, you probably have a cool skin tone. If you can’t determine a clear color, you might have a neutral skin tone.</li>
            <li><strong>Jewelry Test:</strong> Do you look better in gold or silver jewelry? Gold typically complements warm skin tones, while silver is more flattering on cool skin tones.</li>
            <li><strong>Sun Reaction:</strong> How does your skin react to sun exposure? If you tan easily, you might have a warm or neutral skin tone. If you burn easily, you likely have a cool skin tone.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Using Your Skin Tone to Enhance Your Style</h2>
        <p>Once you’ve identified your skin tone, you can make informed decisions about your wardrobe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm Skin Tones:</strong> Opt for earthy colors like browns, oranges, yellows, and warm reds.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool Skin Tones:</strong> Choose jewel tones such as blues, purples, pinks, and cool greens.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral Skin Tones:</strong> You have the flexibility to wear a wide range of colors, both warm and cool.</li>
        </ul>
